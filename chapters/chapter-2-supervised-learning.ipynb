    "##### Supervised Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A **supervised learning** model defines a mapping from one or more inputs to one or more outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `car_year`, `car_mileage` - These variables describe the year and mileage of the car.\n",
    "- **Output**: `car_value` - This is the predicted value of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "`car_mileage` and `car_year` are variables used in an equation to determine the `car_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference is the process by which the model computes an output based on the input. The model equation represents a family of potential relationships between inputs and outputs, where the **parameters** define the specific relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters are a formal representation of latent variables, adjusted during the model's training to optimize accuracy based on the received input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parameters Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a model designed to identify landscapes in pictures. It uses the RGB color spectrum as a parameter; grass is typically green, and the model uses this knowledge as part of its decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a model involves discovering the parameters that best describe the actual relationship between inputs and outputs. The training process involves an algorithm iterating over a set of input/output pairs, adjusting the parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outputs.\n"

    "- **Output ($y$)**: A numerical prediction of the vehicle's value. In some cases, like this one, the output may be a single number.\n",

This is done using a training dataset of $I$ input-output example pairs $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}$. $I$ represents the number of examples in the training set. For instance, if $I=10$, then $(x_5, y_5)$ represents the fifth pair in our dataset.\n",

    "- The $\\arg\\min$ operator identifies the value of $\\phi$ that results in the lowest loss.\n",
    "- $L(\\phi)$, the loss function, reflects the cost or error associated with a specific choice of $\\phi$.\n",
    "- Square brackets are used to encapsulate function arguments, distinguishing them from other mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lower loss indicates a more accurate model. After training, the model is evaluated on its ability to **generalize** to new, unseen data.\n"
