# Understanding Deep Learning - Simplified Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that is intended to simplify and help explain concepts from Simon J.D. Prince's book *Understanding Deep Learning*. It's really just something I'm doing to help myself understand this stuff and I figured why not share it in case it helps someone else.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You have installed the [Jupyter Notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) for Visual Studio Code.
- You have installed the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for Visual Studio Code.

## Using the Notebook

To use the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Visual Studio Code.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
4. Open the `chapter-1-introduction.ipynb` file in Visual Studio Code.
5. Ensure that you have a suitable Python interpreter selected (one that has Jupyter installed).

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue in this repository.
