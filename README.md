# Understanding Deep Learning Notes

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that is intended to simplify and help explain concepts from Simon J.D. Prince's book *Understanding Deep Learning*. It's really just something I'm doing to help myself understand this stuff and I figured why not share it in case it helps someone else.

## Using the Notebook

The notes are in the chapters folder.

If you don't know how to use a Jupyter notebook from a GitHub repo, ask ChatGPT to walk you through it. I use VS Code to make and view them.

## Contributions

Contributions/corrections are welcome. If you have a suggestion that would improve this, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
